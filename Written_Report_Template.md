# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
Our goal is to explore the success rates of campaigns based on their launch dates.

## Analysis and Challenges

Our analysis looks at campaigns in distinct goal categories, ranging from 'Less than $1,000' to 'Greater than $50,000').
COUNTIF is used to summate projects based on their outcome (Successful, Failed, Canceled), and %s calculated across Goal amount categories.
One challenge encountered is that projects exactly equal to $50,000 are not being included in this analysis

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
Theater campaigns seem to be most successful between April and Auguest, with a significant spike in May.
Cancelation does not seem to depend on launch date, as it doesn't move significantly.
We are also not including goals/financial measures, which could be driving these findings (as found in other line graph analysis)

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
Campaigns lower than $5,000 have a drastically higher success rate than other campaigns, while projects greater than ~$40,000 seem to have a significantly lower success rate.
Additionally, Cancelation rates steadily increase as goal totals increase

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
We are not looking at date and goal together. There are questions about our data we can't answer at the moment (are high goals because no initial backers or because it's an ambitious production? etc.)


- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
